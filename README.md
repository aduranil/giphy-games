# Memory

This is a take on the game Concentration, also known as [Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game)). To play, click on any two cards to flip them. If they are a match, they will stay flipped over. If they are not a match, they will flip back after three seconds. You win when you have correctly matched each pair of cards!

To get a new randomized deck, refresh the page. If two cards are not a match, wait for them to flip back over before clicking on another card.
